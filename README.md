# Cubicup Angular Interview

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 13.2.5.

## Install dependencies

Run ``npm install`` to install all required dependencies.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.

## Context
The easiest way to imagine this is like a **marketplace** of videogames that is incomplete.

## What do we expect before our meeting?
1. Install the dependencies.
2. Make sure ``ng-serve`` is working.
3. Feel free to reach us out before start.
4. If you have problems with Angular Cli or any other dependency, do not worry we can share our screen.

## What do we expect in the interview?
1. Think loud. We do not want to have an app working. We want to see how you think and your problem-solving skills.
2. You will be asked for generic topics related with TypeScript. You could be asked also to generate a route and navigate to it.
3. Making an API call that we have simulated in the folder ``assets/@data/products.json``. Do you use obserables?
4. What about use of states, guards, providers?
5. Are you clear about general Angular concepts?
